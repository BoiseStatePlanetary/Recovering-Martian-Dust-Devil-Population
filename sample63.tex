%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.3 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly

%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\usepackage{amsmath}
\documentclass{aastex63}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.3
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.
%
%\AuthorCollaborationLimit=2

%% will only show Schwarz & Muench on the front page of the manuscript

%% Note that all of the author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the

%% this functionality for manuscripts with less than 20 authors. Conversely,
%% please do use this when the number of authors exceeds 40.
%%
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.
%% This command should only be used with \AuthorCollaborationLimit is used.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It

\title{Inferring Vortex and Meteorological Statistics from Insight}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.3 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.3 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.3 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

\begin{abstract}
The Insight Mission has operated on the surface of Mars for nearly two Earth years, returning hundreds of sols worth of data, including detections of the first Marsquakes. The lander also deployed an exquisitely sensitive meteorological instrument package to assess the influence of the atmosphere on the geophysical measurements, as well as imaging cameras to monitor both instrument deployment and local surface activity. In addition to their relevance to Insight geoscience, these latter instruments have detected a variety of boundary layer phenomena, including an unprecedented number of encounters with small-scale vortices. These vortices register as short-lived ($<$ tens of seconds), negative ($<$ a few \% ambient) pressure excursions in the barometric time-series collected by Insight. These vortices closely resemble dust devils, which largely shape climate and air quality on Mars where they are widespread. Puzzlingly, although Insight detected more than 9,000 such vortices and collected hundreds of mid-day images (as reported in \citealp{2020arXiv200501134S}), no active dust devils were imaged -- apparently, all the vortices were dustless. In spite of the lack of dust devil detections, we can leverage the vortex detections and Insight’s daily wind speed measurements to learn about the boundary layer processes that create dust devils. Such an analysis could even help us optimize our vortex detection strategies. In this study, we will discuss our own analysis of Insight’s meteorological data to assess the statistics of vortex and dust devil activity. Comparing these results to Insight’s imagery and space-based observations of the Insight landing site, we can also statistically infer the maximum dust-loading allowed for nearby dust devils.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Introduction}

% 2020 May 16 - Discuss how Greeley et al. (2006) spotted and analyzed dust devils.

% \citet{2010Icar..206..306N} report a dust flux $Q$ that depends on the pressure deficit at the center of a vortex $\Delta P$ as
% \begin{equation}
%     Q = \left(5.79\times10^{-8} {\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}} \right) \left( \Delta P/{\rm Pa}\right)^{3.40}.
%     \label{eqn:Neakrase_dust_flux}
% \end{equation}

%     \caption{Dust flux $Q$ as a function of the pressure dip at the center of a lab-generated vortex $\Delta P$, as reported in \citet{2010Icar..206..306N}.}
%     \label{fig:Neakrase_dust_flux}
% \end{figure}

An in-situ survey could be tailored to test ideas about dust devils. 

\citet{1998JAtS...55.3244R} proposed the ``dust devil activity'' (DDA) parameter, the product of the surface sensible heat flux and a thermodynamic efficiency related to the depth of the planetary boundary layer. During the martian day, the heat flux and boundary layer depth increase as insolation heats the surface. \citet{2019JGRE..124.3442N} conducted large eddy simulations of the environment in and around Gale Crater to assess the DDA, along with other micrometeorological parameters as a function of position and time-of-day. The study then compared those model predictions to the rate at which short-lived dips appeared in the barometric time-series, likely indicative of vortex encounters. The study found that the frequency of vortex encounters scaled with DDA.

However, in \citet{1998JAtS...55.3244R}, the actual relationship between DDA and dust devil properties remains unclear: whether a larger DDA translates into a higher frequency of dust devils, more large dust devils, more vigorous dust devils. The results in \citet{2019JGRE..124.3442N} suggest the frequency at least increases with DDA, but it is not clear whether the increased frequency arose from higher surface winds (which would more quickly advect vortices past the sensor). Also unknown was whether the detected vortices exhibited deeper pressure excursions or more vigorous winds. A tailored imaging survey for dust devils, especially combined with a meteorological dataset, could disentangle the influence of DDA on dust devil properties. 

The detailed influence of dust devils on Mars' atmosphere likewise remain obscure. 

For this study, we will consider two types of dust devil detections and analyses: the first involves dust devils far enough from the instrument suite that they are analyzed using only imagery; the second involves dust devils that pass over the instruments. The latter detection has the potential to more directly elucidate the pressure, temperature, and wind structures within a dust devil, as well as the dust abundance but requires a rare encounter at a distance from a devil's center not much more than the eyewall diameter. The former detection may also reveal the dust content but indirectly, via a analysis of the image contrast; however such detections are much more common since they can be made out to the resolution of the imaging system and may therefore provide a more robust assessment of dust devil statistics. 

% Define areal density N

The atmospheric influence of a dust devil population depends on the areal density of dust devil occurrence and the dust flux for each. Thus, accurately assessing that influence requires accurate estimates of the both.

\section{Pressure Time-Series Data and Analysis}
In this section, we describe our analysis of the APSS pressure time-series.

    \caption{(a) The pressure time-series for sol 392, as blue dots. The vertical orange lines highlight the detected vortex signals. (b) The time-series after application of the mean boxcar filter. Apparent by eye, the scatter in the time-series increases around mid-day. (c) Convolution of the matched filter with the time-series in (b). The horizontal dashed orange line shows the detection threshold of 5. (d) A model fit (solid orange line) to the deepest vortex discovered on sol 392, along with the model fit parameters -- each point's uncertainty is calculated via $1.4826\ \times$ the median absolute deviation in the window centered on that point.}
    \label{fig:data_conditioning_and_fit}
\end{figure}

We analyzed the pressure time-series collected by Insight's Auxiliary Payload Sensor Subsystem or APSS, which measures the local magnetic field, wind, and atmospheric temperature, in addition to ambient pressure. In this sect

% Summary of the instruments
\citet{2018SSRv..214..109S} and \citet{2020NatGe..13..190B} provide details of the instrument calibration and operation. 

Figure \ref{fig:data_conditioning_and_fit}(a) shows the time-series for sol 392, a representative dataset. The vertical dashed orange lines show the vortex signals.

As in previous work \citep[e.g.][]{2016JGRE..121.1514K}, we model the vortex signals using a steady-state modified Lorentzian profile $L(t)$:
\begin{equation}
    L(t) = \frac{-\Delta P_{\rm obs}}{1 + \left( \frac{ t - t_0 }{\Gamma_{\rm obs}/2} \right)^2},\label{eqn:Lorentzian_profile}
\end{equation}
where $t$ is the time of each datum, $\Delta P_{\rm obs}$ is the maximum pressure excursion observed (a positive number) at the center of vortex signal, $t_0$ the central time, and $\Gamma_{\rm obs}$ the observed profile full-width/half-max (FWHM). This profile assumes the vortex travels past the sensor on a simple linear trajectory with a unidirectional and constant velocity $U$. 

In addition to vortex signals and Gaussian (white) noise, the data also exhibit long-term variations of timescales typically much longer (minutes to hours) than the vortex signals -- Figure \ref{fig:data_conditioning_and_fit}(a). To suppress these longer-term signals and facilitate detection of the vortices, we apply a mean boxcar filter with a window size $W$ before sifting the data for vortices. Figure \ref{fig:data_conditioning_and_fit}(b) shows the resulting detrended time-series $\Delta P$. Any time-series analysis scheme will unavoidably involve selection effects that can skew the recovered population of signals \citep{2018Icar..299..166J}, and we explore its biases and how those influence the final recovered population of vortices in the Appendix (Section \ref{sec:Vortex Recovery Statistics}). Based on that analysis, we chose $W = 3000\,{\rm s}$. 

Next, to recover the pressure signatures of vortices, we employ a matched filter approach \citep[][ch.~13]{Press2007} using a normalized Lorentzian profile with a known FWHW $\Gamma$; that is, we march a Lorentzian profile, point-by-point, across the time series, convolving it with the time-series. Based on our analysis discussed in the Appendix (Section \ref{sec:Vortex Recovery Statistics}), we chose $\Gamma = 1\,{\rm s}$. This process produces the equivalent of a spectrum, with large positive spikes when the filter encounters other Lorentzian-like signals. We subtract the median value from this raw spectrum and then normalize it by the standard deviation (as estimated by $1.4826\ \times$ the median absolute deviation -- \citealp{doi:10.1080/01621459.1993.10476408}). We consider peaks rising above the detection threshold of 5 to be vortices. Figure \ref{fig:data_conditioning_and_fit}(c) shows this normalized spectrum for the time-series in panel (b), along with the purported vortex signals (vertical dashed orange lines). 

Finally, considering the original, undetrended time-series (e.g., Figure \ref{fig:data_conditioning_and_fit}(a)), we use the Leverberg-Marquardt algorithm \citep[cf.][]{Press2007} to fit the time-series in a window 30-FWHMs wide around each vortex signal. We fit a Lorentzian profile (Equation \ref{eqn:Lorentzian_profile}) combined with a linear trend, returning best fit parameters $t_0$, $\Delta P_{\rm obs}$, and $\Gamma_{\rm obs}$, as well as the background slope and intercept. Fitting such a model to the original, undetrended instead of the detrended time-series avoids the distorting effect of the boxcar filter on the vortex signal while taking into account any background trend. Figure \ref{fig:data_conditioning_and_fit}(d) shows such a fit (with the background intercept subtracted out).

\section{Results and Discussion}

What do these choices mean about our ability to accurately recover the vortex population? The answer will depend, in part, on the properties of the vortex population itself, and \citet{2018Icar..299..166J} discuss many of the relevant details. In brief, in order for our scheme to detect a vortex with given $\Delta P_{\rm act}$- and $D_{\rm act}$-values, it must register in the time-series with 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta P_{\rm obs} &=& \frac{\Delta P_{\rm act}}{1 + \left(2b/D_{\rm act}\right)^2} &>& P_{\rm min},\label{eqn:Pobs} 
\end{equation}
where $b$ is the closest approach distance between the sensor and the vortex center and $P_{\rm min}$ is the minimum pressure excursion detectable. Figure \ref{fig:vortex_recovery} shows that, for $\log \Gamma/\Gamma_{\rm obs} < 0.5$ at least, $\Delta P_{\rm obs} \gtrsim 0.3 \sigma_P$. In other words, for the typical APSS pressure time-series with $\sigma_P \lesssim 1\,{\rm Pa}$ (Figure \ref{fig:Pobsprime-sigmaP_vs_W}(b)), we could, in principle, recover vortices with $\Delta P_{\rm obs} \approx 0.3\,{\rm Pa}$. Since the sampling rate for the APSS barometer (1 Hz) means we cannot detect devils with durations $\Gamma_{\rm obs} < 1\,{\rm s}$, we take $\Gamma = 1\,{\rm s}$ for our matched filter, meaning the limit imposed by $\Gamma/\Gamma_{\rm obs}$ is easily dealt with.

With these choices, the maximum distance out to which we could detect a vortex is given by
\begin{equation}
    b_{\rm max} = \left( \frac{D_{\rm act}}{2} \right) \sqrt{ \frac{\Delta P_{\rm act}}{\Delta P_{\rm min}} - 1 }. \label{eqn:bmax}
\end{equation} 

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:Introduction}, the quantity of meteorological interest is $N$, the number of vortices per unit area, which can be estimated from the total number of vortex detections, $k$, via
\begin{equation}
    k = 2 N U T b_{\rm max} = N U T D_{\rm act} \sqrt{ \frac{\Delta P_{\rm act}}{\Delta P_{\rm min}} - 1 }, \label{eqn:number_of_encounters}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the total duration of the survey (which may consist of multiple observational sequences spread over many sols). (If $N$ and $U$ evolve with time (as they usually do), this estimate can be converted into an integral over time.) A reasonable assumption is that vortex encounters represent a Poisson process \citep[cf.][]{Press2007}, and so we can estimate the uncertainty on $k$ as $\sigma_k = \sqrt{k}$ and therefrom the uncertainty $\sigma_N$ via
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sigma_N}{N} = \frac{\sigma_k}{k} = k^{-1/2} = \left ( N U T D_{\rm act} \right)^{-1/2} \left( \frac{\Delta P_{\rm act}}{\Delta P_{\rm min}} - 1 \right)^{-1/4}.
    \label{eqn:sigma_N}
\end{equation}

\section{Camera Model}
To begin with, we outline the very basic characteristics of our model camera. By design, the considerations here are simplistic and general, rendering them applicable to a wide range of imaging systems. Consider a camera angled to have a clear view of the horizon and with a horizontal field-of-view $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$ centered on azimuth $\lambda$ and an angular resolution $\alpha$ measured in angle per pixel (Figure \ref{fig:Awedge}). Consider also a dust devil with a fixed diameter $D$, height $H$, and a sufficient contrast against the image background that it can be detected. Such a dust devil could be resolved at a distance from the camera $r_{\rm max} = D/\alpha$. For example, to resolve a dust devil with $D = 10\,{\rm m}$ with three pixels across, if $\alpha = 0.3\,{\rm mrad\ pix^{-1}} \times 3\,{\rm pix} \approx 1\,{\rm mrad}$ (similar to the Mars 2020 Mastcam-Z - \citealp{2017E&SS....4..396B}), $r_{\rm max} \approx 10\,{\rm km}$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Awedge.jpg}
    \caption{Observational geometry. The camera has a field-of-view is $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$ and an angular resolution $\alpha$ which allows it to resolve dust devils of diameter $D$ out to a radial distance $r_{\rm max}$. The area surveyed is $A_{\rm wedge}$.}
    \label{fig:Awedge}
\end{figure}

In principle, the camera could detect this dust devil if it traversed the pie-wedge of terrain centered on $\lambda$ and having an area 
\begin{equation}
    A_{\rm wedge} = \frac{\Delta_{\rm FOV} r_{\rm max}^2}{2} = \frac{\Delta_{\rm FOV}D^2}{2 \alpha^2}.
    \label{eqn:A_wedge}
\end{equation}
Taking the same $D$ and $\alpha$-values as above, along with $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = \pi/2\,{\rm rad}$ gives $A_{\rm wedge} \sim 100\,{\rm km^2}$. If dust devils traveled very slowly (or not at all) from their origin point, then the survey would only include devils that appeared within this wedge. However, as pointed out in \citet{2014JAtS...71.4461L}, advection of dust devils through a survey site increases the effective area surveyed. 

Consider a fixed, unidirectional wind of speed $U$ crossing perpendicularly through the pie-wedge. If the dust devil under consideration has a lifetime $\tau$, then it will travel a distance $L = \tau U$ before dissipating. Thus, the wind field can advect dust devils into the camera's field-of-view acting as a conveyor belt with area
\begin{equation}
    A_{\rm adv} = r_{\rm max} L = \frac{D U \tau}{\alpha}.
    \label{eqn:A_adv}
\end{equation}
Again, typical values $D \sim 10\,{\rm m}$, $U \sim 10\,{\rm m\ s^{-1}}$, $\tau \sim 100\,{\rm s}$, and $\alpha \sim 1\,{\rm mrad}$ gives $A_{\rm adv} \sim 10\,{\rm km^2} \ll A_{\rm wedge}$. Although both areas contribute, we neglect $A_{\rm adv}$ compared to $A_{\rm wedge}$, and we use this estimate for the area surveyed $A_{\rm survey} \approx A_{\rm wedge}$ to determine how the inferred population of dust devils depends on the survey parameters.

\section{Imaging Surveys for Distant Dust Devils}
First, we consider the accuracy with which we could infer the occurrence rate of dust devils detected very distant from the instrument suite and that register only on the camera instrument. We can relate the areal density $N$ (dust devils per unit area) for a certain period of interest from the total number of dust devils observed in a single image $k$:
\begin{equation}
   N = \frac{k}{A_{\rm survey}} = \left( \frac{2 \alpha^2}{\Delta_{\rm FOV} D^2} \right)\ k.
    \label{eqn:areal_occurrence}
\end{equation}

If we assume that dust devil occurrence is a Poisson process, then we can estimate the standard deviation or uncertainty on $k$ as $\sigma_k = \sqrt{k}$ and the uncertainty $\sigma_N$ on our estimate of $N$ via
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sigma_N}{N} = \frac{\sigma_k}{k} = k^{-1/2} = \sqrt{2} N^{-1/2} D^{-1}\ \Delta_{\rm FOV}^{-1/2} \alpha.
    \label{eqn:sigma_N}
\end{equation}

    \label{fig:DDs_vs_Delta}
\end{figure}

% Usually, we would design our survey so that we achieve a sufficiently precise estimate for the quantity of physical significance $N$. In other words, we would require $\sigma_N/N < T$, some threshold. We can see that Equation \ref{eqn:sigma_N} provides the specific requirements to achieve the desired threshold. For instance, we can take some typical values from \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} and estimate what minimum angular resolution is required of our camera to achieve $T = 0.1$:
% \begin{equation}
%     \alpha < 2^{-1/2} T \left( n t \right)^{1/2} D\ \Delta_{\rm FOV}^{1/2} = 2^{-1/2} \left( 0.1 \right) \big[ \left( 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}} \right) \left( 1\,{\rm hr} \right) \big]^{1/2} \left( 10\,{\rm m} \right) \left( \pi/2\,{\rm rad} \right)^{1/2} \approx 0.2\,{\rm mrad}.
%     \label{eqn:alpha_example}
% \end{equation}
% Such an angular resolution is about ten times better than is usually achieved -- the MER Hazcams used for the survey in \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} had a resolution of $2\,{\rm mrad/pix}$ \citep{2003JGRE..108.8071M}.

Another application of Equation \ref{eqn:sigma_N} might instead involve assuming requiring a minimum survey accuracy $T = \sigma_N/N$ and asking, for a given camera field-of-view, what angular resolution is required. Figure \ref{fig:alpha_vs_Delta} shows the result: an accuracy of $T = 50\%$ can be achieved with $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 150^\circ$ and a modest $\alpha = 1\,{\rm mrad}$ (i.e., resolving a dust devil with pixels across if the pixels each have a resolution of $0.3\,{\rm mrad\, pix^{-1}}$), again for $N = 0.03\,{\rm km^{-2}}$.

\end{figure}

However, dust devils are usually active only for a few hours during each day (or sol on Mars) -- \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} found negligible activity before 9 a.m. LTST or after 5 p.m. LTST. Moreover, the occurrence rate itself seemed to evolve over the course of the active phase, increasing from $0.005\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ early in the morning to  $0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ around noon. This mid-day peak agrees with meteorological predictions that dust devil activity should increase as the planetary boundary layer deepens with increasing surface heating \citep{doi:10.1029/2010RG000351}. Accurately estimating the occurrence rate requires a survey duration not longer than the timescale of variability, i.e., about an hour. Therefore, the 25-hours of survey required to recover $n = 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ to 10\% accuracy would have to be spread into 1-hour surveys around noon spanning 25 sols. (And, of course, smaller occurrence rates would require additional time.) 

Similarly, \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} reported an occurrence rate that varied with season and $L_{\rm S}$. Assuming sufficient daily coverage to accurately capture the daily occurrence rate (i.e., a large enough value for $n t$), we can ask what $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$ might be required to recover the seasonal variability by looking at the expected variation in $n t$. From its peak in spring to the peak in summer, $n t$ dropped from $0.11\,{\rm km^{-2}}$ to $0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}}$, which would require a precision $\sigma_n/n \sim 0.5$. Solving Equation \ref{eqn:sigma_n} gives $\Delta_{\rm FOV} \approx 65^\circ$. Considering instead the maximum $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 360^\circ$ and an areal occurrence $nt = 0.11\,{\rm km^{-2}}$ suggests we could recover dozens of 10-m wide dust devils. 

Importantly, all these calculations up till now have assumed a single dust devil diameter, $D$. In fact, dust devils span a range of diameters - \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} reported values between 2 and $276\,{\rm m}$, while orbital studies have reported devils hundreds of meters across \citep{2008Icar..197...39S}. However, the distribution of diameters appears to follow a steep power law, with an exponent between 1 and 2 \citep{2016SSRv..203..277L}. Consequently, the majority of devils reported in \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} lay between 10 and $20\,{\rm m}$, and so $n$ is dominated by devils in this range and the calculations presented so far may be considered reasonably representative. In addition, for a given angular resolution, larger dust devils can be recovered from farther away, an observational bias that has been previously pointed out \citep{2012Icar..219..556K, 2013Icar..226..964L}.

On the other hand, given that larger dust devils are less common, they may be intrinsically less likely to be recovered. Equation \ref{eqn:areal_occurrence_rate} may be adapted to allow for a distribution of dust devils by diameter by simply taking $n$ to represent the areal occurrence rate in a narrow range of diameters and $k$ to represent the number of devils observed within that same range of diameters. From Equation \ref{eqn:areal_occurrence_rate}, we can see that if $n$ were a steeply declining function of $D$ (e.g., $n \propto D^{-3}$), then the total number of devils recovered with smaller diameters would exceed the number with larger diameters in proportion to $D^{-1}$.

More than simply counting dust devils, a survey might consider also assessing dust devil dynamics. In their survey, \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} constructed 21-frame short movies of dust devils in order to estimate their advective motions. By tracking the motions of visually distinct eddies within dust devils, they also estimated vertical velocities, ranging from $0.2$ to $8.8\,{\rm m\ s^{-1}}$, and therefrom the atmospheric dust flux. 

In addition to sufficient time resolution (the movies analyzed in \citealt{2006JGRE..11112S09G} had a few seconds between frames), such an estimate requires sufficient angular resolution. Eddies within a dust devil span a range of sizes but all smaller than the host devil itself. In order for the motion of such an eddy to be resolvable, it must span a few pixels. At a minimum, the devil itself must be larger, occupying many times as pixels as the eddy, a minimum number of pixels $p_{\rm min}$.

In order for a dust devil with diameter $D$ to occupy $p_{\rm min}$ pixels, it must pass within a radial distance $r$ of the camera, given by 
\begin{equation}
    r \le \frac{D}{p_{\rm min} \alpha}.
    \label{eqn:encounter_distance}
\end{equation}
Passing within that radial distance requires the devil to pass through a pie-wedge area $A$ smaller than that corresponding to $r_{\rm max}$ but with the same opening angle $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$.

The time between encounters with such a dust devil $\tau_{\rm enc}$ can be estimated using $r$:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{\rm enc} = \left( n A \right)^{-1} = \bigg[ \left( \frac{n \Delta_{\rm FOV}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{D}{p_{\rm min} \alpha } \right)^2 \bigg]^{-1}.
    \label{eqn:tau}
\end{equation}
For example, if we require a 10-m dust devil occupies 10 pixels (i.e., passes within $1\,{\rm km}$ of a camera with $\alpha = 1\,{\rm mrad}$ and $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 65^\circ$), with $n = 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$, $\tau_{\rm enc} = 35\,{\rm hrs}$. In other words, a survey would require 35 hours of observation for such a small devil to pass so close to the camera. Assuming the same occurrence rate for 100-m devils, the same encounter distance would only require $\tau_{\rm enc} \approx 20\,{\rm min}$. However, the relative rarity of such large dust devils means encounters with such large devils would occur rarely. Figure \ref{fig:encounter_time} shows the encounter times for different diameters and various fields-of-view.

\section{Assessing the Dust Flux}
Accurate recovery of the dust devil population, in particular the largest devils, may be critical to assess the contribution of dust devils to the martian dust budget. By tracking vertical velocities and optical depths within imaged dust devils, \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} estimated dust flux values $q$ for 300 devils, with values ranging between $3.95\times10^{−9}$ and $4.59\times10^{−4}\,{\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ with an average $2.07\times10^{−5}\,{\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$, although no information is given regarding the dependence on diameter or any other parameter. Assuming this dust flux applies uniformly across diameter, it suggests the total dust contribution for a devil scales with that devil's areal footprint, i.e.~with $D^2$. We can use these values to explore how well we can estimate the dust flux for a given dust devil population.

Taking the areal occurrence rate of dust devils with a diameter within a small interval around $D$ as $dn/dD = n_0 D^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma$ between 1 and 2 \citep{2016SSRv..203..277L}. (As before, the area of an individual dust devil does not factor into the areal occurrence rate.) This expression translates into a number of devils observed during a survey of duration $t$ and within a narrow range of diameters $dk/dD = \left( dn/dD \right) A_{\rm survey} t$. Taking the rate of dust mass lifting for a single devil as $Q = q\ \pi D^2$, we can estimate the population-weighted rate as 
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\rm tot} = \int_{D_{\rm min}}^{D_{\rm max}} \left( \frac{dk}{dD} \right) q\ \pi D^2 dD = \int_{D_{\rm min}}^{D_{\rm max}} n_0 D^{-\gamma} \left( \frac{t \Delta_{\rm FOV} D^2}{2 \alpha^2} \right) q \pi D^2\ dD.
    \label{eqn:dust_lifted}
\end{equation}
Although the dust flux $q$ likely depends on $D$ itself, the dependence is unknown, and so for simplicity, we will assume $q = {\rm const.}$, yielding 
\begin{equation}
    \langle Q \rangle = \pi q n_0 \left( \frac{t \Delta_{\rm FOV}}{2 \alpha^2} \right) \left( \frac{D_{\rm max}^{5 - \gamma} - D_{\rm min}^{5 - \gamma}}{5 - \gamma} \right) \approx \left( \frac{ \pi q n_0 }{2 \left( 5 - \gamma \right)} \right) \left( \frac{t \Delta_{\rm FOV}}{\alpha^2} \right) D_{\rm max}^{5 - \gamma},
    \label{eqn:solved_dust_lifted}
\end{equation}
with $\gamma < 5$ and $D_{\rm min} \ll D_{\rm max}$. For a representative estimate, we can take $q = 2.07\times10^{−5}\,{\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$, $n_0 = 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$, $\gamma = 1$, $t = 25\,{\rm hrs}$, $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 65^\circ$, $\alpha = 1\,{\rm mrad}$, and $D_{\rm max} = 100\,{\rm m}$, giving an estimate $\langle Q \rangle \approx 4 {\rm g\ hr^{-1}}$.

\section{Vortex Recovery Statistics}
\label{sec:Vortex Recovery Statistics}
In this section, we describe our analysis of our vortex recovery statistics. We explored the effects of the mean boxcar filter on both the time-series scatter but also on the detected vortices, as well as the effectivenesss of our matched filter approach.

For our study here, the mean boxcar filter  acts as high-pass filter on the APSS pressure time-series and, in principle, should induce little distortion on signals much narrower than the filter window size $W$. However, some vortices have quite long durations (many tens of seconds), and so they may be prone to distortion if we used a small enough window. As a measure of this distortion, we can calculate how much less deep a vortex profile would appear after applying the filter by calculating the convolution of a boxcar function $B(t)$ against a Lorentzian profile, where $B(t)$ is $1/W$ within the window ($-W/2 < t < +W/2$):
\begin{equation}
    \Delta P_{\rm obs}^\prime = \int_{t = -W/2}^{+W/2} \left( \frac{1}{W} \right) \left( \frac{-\Delta P_{\rm obs}}{1 + \left( \frac{t}{\Gamma_{\rm obs}/2} \right)^2} \right) = -\left( \frac{\Delta P_{\rm obs} \Gamma_{\rm obs}}{W}\right) \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{W}{\Gamma_{\rm obs}} \right), \label{eqn:tophat_convolution}
\end{equation}
where we have taken the Lorenztian to be center at $t_0 = 0$ and $\Delta P_{\rm obs}^\prime$ represents the distorted profile depth. Figure \ref{fig:Pobsprime-sigmaP_vs_W}(a) shows the result: for windows more than 100 times the profile's original width (i.e., $W/\Gamma_{\rm obs} > 10^2$), the profile width is more than 98\% of its original value, indicating minimal distortion. 

Of course, the narrower the window, the more effectively we can reduce the long-term variations in the time-series that may otherwise obscure the vortices. To explore that effect, we applied mean boxcar filters of various widths $W$ to each sol's pressure time-series and then estimated the resulting scatter via $1.4826\ \times$ the median absolute deviation \citep{doi:10.1080/01621459.1993.10476408}. Figure \ref{fig:Pobsprime-sigmaP_vs_W}(b) shows that for the time-series for sol 435 exhibited the largest scatter for any value of $W$, while that for sol 269 exhibited the smallest. The time-series for sol 392 had values near the median for each given $W$. In all cases, as $W$ increases, so does the scatter, consistent with our expectations that less aggressive filtering (i.e., $W$ larger) leaves more noise. We fit Lorentzian profiles to the vortices reported in \citet{2020arXiv200501134S} and found that the largest $\Gamma_{\rm obs} \approx 300\,{\rm s}$. Therefore, we took $W = 3000\,{\rm s}$, meaning that even the most distorted vortices should have $\Delta P_{\rm obs}^\prime/\Delta P_{\rm obs} > 0.8$.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Pobsprime-sigmaP_vs_W.png}
    \caption{(a) Comparing the pressure excursion observed before $\Delta P_{\rm obs}$ application of the mean boxcar filter and after $\Delta P_{\rm obs}^\prime$ as a function of the width of the filter $W$ and of the vortex signal $\Gamma_{\rm obs}$. (b) Scatter in the pressure time-series $\sigma_P$ for the sol with the largest (sol 435) and least (sol 269) values as a function of the window size $W$ for the mean boxcar filter. Sol 392 has scatter close the median value for all sols. }
    \label{fig:Pobsprime-sigmaP_vs_W}
\end{figure}

Finally, we must interpret these results in terms of our ability to recover vortices using our matched filter approach. In particular, we need to know the best shape for the matched filter: too narrow a filter might miss wider vortex profiles, while a wide filter could average out narrow profiles. To that end, we generated 500,000 synthetic time-series (200 distinct simulations for each of 2500 combinations of model parameters discussed below). This time-series had the same sampling as the APSS time-series and white noise with a wide range of variances $\sigma_\text{P}^2$. Into these time-series, we injected vortex signals with known depths and widths. Then, we applied a matched filter with width $\Gamma$ to see the range of values we retrieved for the convolution of the filter against the synthetic time-series, $\left( F \ast P \right)$. Figure \ref{fig:vortex_recovery} illustrates the range of such values and indicates that, for a very wide range of vortices, noise levels, and matched filter widths, we can successfully recover the vortices. Indeed, Figure \ref{fig:vortex_recovery} shows we could even recover very subtle vortices, given the right filter width. For example, for $\Delta P_{\rm obs}/\sigma_P$ (i.e., a vortex that barely rises above the noise), a wide range of filter widths $\Gamma$ returns $\left( F \ast P \right) \geq 5 $. Of course, the noise model discussed here does not include the non-white (red) noise that pervades the real APSS data. However, based on the results here (and on additional experimentation with the real APSS time-series), we choose $\left( F \ast P \right) \geq 5 $ as our vortex detection threshold.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/vortex_recovery.png}
    \caption{How effectively a convolution of a synthetic pressure time-series with the matched filter ($F \ast P$) recovers a vortex. The vortex has a known depth $\Delta P_\text{obs}$ and width $\Gamma_\text{obs}$ and is embedded in a synthetic time-series with white noise of variance $\sigma_\text{P}^2$. The matched filtered has a width $\Gamma$. The dashed, white line shows the threshold for detection used in this study ($F \ast P \geq 5$). In principle, vortices with values of $\Delta P_\text{obs}\sigma_P$ and $\Gamma/\Gamma_\text{obs}$ above and to the left of that line could be recovered.}

% For N estimate, with about 6 hours per day of dust devil activity (1/4 day),
%   1 km^{-2} day^{-1} translates into about 0.25 km^{-2}.

% We can compare our estimate for the daily number of vortex encounters and the associated sampling uncertainty from Equations \ref{eqn:number_of_encounters} and \label{eqn:sigma_N} to the actual numbers reported in \citet{2020arXiv200501134S} by plugging in representative values: \citet{2020arXiv200501134S} report typical wind speeds $U \sim 5\,{\rm m\ s^{-1}}$ and vortex activity during about $12\, {\rm hours}$ each sol over about 400 sols; monitoring dust devil tracks around the Insight landing site, \citet{2020GeoRL..4787234P} suggest $N = 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ sol} \times \left(12\,{\rm hours\ sol^{-1}}\right) = 0.025\,{\rm km^{-2}}$ and $D_{\rm act} \approx 10\,{\rm m}$; \citet{2018Icar..299..166J} suggests $P_{\rm act} \approx 1\,{\rm Pa}$; and our analysis here gives $P_{\rm min} \approx 0.3\,{\rm Pa}$. Taken altogether, we estimate Insight could detect vortices out to a distance $b_{\rm max} \approx 8\,{\rm m}$ distance and should have recovered about 

recover the population with $\sigma_N/N \approx 20\%$.

% \section{Effects of Undersampling the Dust Devil Profile}
% With too low a sampling frequency, the pressure profile for a dust devil will be undersampled, potentially distorting the inferred profile shape and depth. Fourier analysis of the pressure profile can show the dependence of the distortion on the angular sampling frequency $\omega$.

% We start by assuming a Lorentzian profile $L(t)$ in time $t$ for the dust devil:
% \begin{equation}
%     L(t) = -\frac{\Delta P}{1 + \left( t/\Gamma \right)^2},
%     \label{eqn:appendix_lorentzian}
% \end{equation}{}
% where $\Delta P$ is the profile depth and $\Gamma$ its duration. The Fourier transform of this profile $F(\omega)$ is 
% \begin{equation}
%     F(\omega) = -\pi \Delta P\ \Gamma e^{-|\omega| \Gamma}.
%     \label{eqn:appendix_lorentzian_fourier}
% \end{equation}{}

% If we now imagine that we undersampled the profile using frequencies below some maximum, $\omega \le \omega_{\rm max}$, then we can estimate the resulting distorted profile $L^\prime(t)$ by taking the inverse, partial Fourier transform of $F(t)$, i.e.
% \begin{equation}
%     L^\prime(t) \equiv \int_{\omega = -\omega_{\rm max}}^{\omega_{\rm max}}\ \left( -\pi \Delta P \Gamma e^{-|\omega| \Gamma}\right) \ \left( \frac{e^{+i\omega t}\ d\omega}{2 \pi} \right)
%     = L(t) \bigg[ 1 - \left( \cos \left( \omega_{\rm max} t \right) - \left( \frac{t}{\Gamma} \right) \sin \left( \omega_{\rm max} t \right) \right) e^{-\omega_{\rm max} \Gamma} \bigg].
%     \label{eqn:appendix_inverse_fourier}
% \end{equation}{}

% We expect the register the maximum (in magnitude) pressure excursion at the center of the profile, i.e. $L(t = 0) = \Delta P$, and so to estimate the incorrect profile depth $\Delta P^\prime$ arising from this distorted profile, we can evaluate $L^\prime(t)$ at the same time, giving:
% \begin{equation}
%     \Delta P^\prime = \Delta P \left( 1 - e^{-\omega_{\rm max}\Gamma} \right).
% \end{equation}{}
% The distortion decreases rapidly with $\omega_{\rm max}$, and for a sampling frequency of, for example, $2\,{\rm Hz}$ ($\omega_{\rm max} = 2\pi \times (2\,{\rm Hz})$) and a very narrow profile $\Gamma = 0.5\,{\rm s}$, $\Delta P^\prime$ is only 0.2\% different from $\Delta P$.

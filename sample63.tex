%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.3 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\usepackage{amsmath}
\documentclass{aastex63}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex63}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published

%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.3
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.

\title{Optimizing In-Situ Dust Devil Surveys}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.3 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.3 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.3 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

%% Note that the \and command from previous versions of AASTeX is now
%% depreciated in this version as it is no longer necessary. AASTeX 
%% automatically takes care of all commas and "and"s between authors names.

%% AASTeX 6.3 has the new \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands to
%% provide the collaboration status of a group of authors. These commands 
%% can be used either before or after the list of corresponding authors. The
%% argument for \collaboration is the collaboration identifier. Authors are
%% encouraged to surround collaboration identifiers with ()s. The 
%% \nocollaboration command takes no argument and exists to indicate that
%% the nearby authors are not part of surrounding collaborations.

%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:Introduction}

% 2020 May 16 - Discuss how Greeley et al. (2006) spotted and analyzed dust devils.

% \citet{2010Icar..206..306N} report a dust flux $Q$ that depends on the pressure deficit at the center of a vortex $\Delta P$ as
% \begin{equation}
%     Q = \left(5.79\times10^{-8} {\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}} \right) \left( \Delta P/{\rm Pa}\right)^{3.40}.
%     \label{eqn:Neakrase_dust_flux}

%     \label{fig:Neakrase_dust_flux}
% \end{figure}

An in-situ survey could be tailored to test ideas about dust devils. 

\citet{1998JAtS...55.3244R} proposed the ``dust devil activity'' (DDA) parameter, the product of the surface sensible heat flux and a thermodynamic efficiency related to the depth of the planetary boundary layer. During the martian day, the heat flux and boundary layer depth increase as insolation heats the surface. \citet{2019JGRE..124.3442N} conducted large eddy simulations of the environment in and around Gale Crater to assess the DDA, along with other micrometeorological parameters as a function of position and time-of-day. The study then compared those model predictions to the rate at which short-lived dips appeared in the barometric time-series, likely indicative of vortex encounters. The study found that the frequency of vortex encounters scaled with DDA.

However, in \citet{1998JAtS...55.3244R}, the actual relationship between DDA and dust devil properties remains unclear: whether a larger DDA translates into a higher frequency of dust devils, more large dust devils, more vigorous dust devils. The results in \citet{2019JGRE..124.3442N} suggest the frequency at least increases with DDA, but it is not clear whether the increased frequency arose from higher surface winds (which would more quickly advect vortices past the sensor). Also unknown was whether the detected vortices exhibited deeper pressure excursions or more vigorous winds. A tailored imaging survey for dust devils, especially combined with a meteorological dataset, could disentangle the influence of DDA on dust devil properties. 

The detailed influence of dust devils on Mars' atmosphere likewise remain obscure. 

For this study, we will consider two types of dust devil detections and analyses: the first involves dust devils far enough from the instrument suite that they are analyzed using only imagery; the second involves dust devils that pass over the instruments. The latter detection has the potential to more directly elucidate the pressure, temperature, and wind structures within a dust devil, as well as the dust abundance but requires a rare encounter at a distance from a devil's center not much more than the eyewall diameter. The former detection may also reveal the dust content but indirectly, via a analysis of the image contrast; however such detections are much more common since they can be made out to the resolution of the imaging system and may therefore provide a more robust assessment of dust devil statistics. 

The atmospheric influence of a dust devil population depends on the areal density of dust devil occurrence and the dust flux for each. Thus, accurately assessing that influence requires accurate estimates of the both. 

\section{Camera Model}
To begin with, we outline the very basic characteristics of our model camera. By design, the considerations here are simplistic and general, rendering them applicable to a wide range of imaging systems. Consider a camera angled to have a clear view of the horizon and with a horizontal field-of-view $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$ centered on azimuth $\lambda$ and an angular resolution $\alpha$ measured in angle per pixel (Figure \ref{fig:Awedge}). Consider also a dust devil with a fixed diameter $D$, height $H$, and a sufficient contrast against the image background that it can be detected. Such a dust devil could be resolved at a distance from the camera $r_{\rm max} = D/\alpha$. For example, to resolve a dust devil with $D = 10\,{\rm m}$ with three pixels across, if $\alpha = 0.3\,{\rm mrad\ pix^{-1}} \times 3\,{\rm pix} \approx 1\,{\rm mrad}$ (similar to the Mars 2020 Mastcam-Z - \citealp{2017E&SS....4..396B}), $r_{\rm max} \approx 10\,{\rm km}$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/Awedge.jpg}
    \caption{Observational geometry. The camera has a field-of-view is $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$ and an angular resolution $\alpha$ which allows it to resolve dust devils of diameter $D$ out to a radial distance $r_{\rm max}$. The area surveyed is $A_{\rm wedge}$.}
    \label{fig:Awedge}
\end{figure}

In principle, the camera could detect this dust devil if it traversed the pie-wedge of terrain centered on $\lambda$ and having an area 
\begin{equation}
    A_{\rm wedge} = \frac{\Delta_{\rm FOV} r_{\rm max}^2}{2} = \frac{\Delta_{\rm FOV}D^2}{2 \alpha^2}.
    \label{eqn:A_wedge}
\end{equation}
Taking the same $D$ and $\alpha$-values as above, along with $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = \pi/2\,{\rm rad}$ gives $A_{\rm wedge} \sim 100\,{\rm km^2}$. If dust devils traveled very slowly (or not at all) from their origin point, then the survey would only include devils that appeared within this wedge. However, as pointed out in \citet{2014JAtS...71.4461L}, advection of dust devils through a survey site increases the effective area surveyed. 

Consider a fixed, unidirectional wind of speed $U$ crossing perpendicularly through the pie-wedge. If the dust devil under consideration has a lifetime $\tau$, then it will travel a distance $L = \tau U$ before dissipating. Thus, the wind field can advect dust devils into the camera's field-of-view acting as a conveyor belt with area
\begin{equation}
    A_{\rm adv} = r_{\rm max} L = \frac{D U \tau}{\alpha}.
    \label{eqn:A_adv}
\end{equation}
Again, typical values $D \sim 10\,{\rm m}$, $U \sim 10\,{\rm m\ s^{-1}}$, $\tau \sim 100\,{\rm s}$, and $\alpha \sim 1\,{\rm mrad}$ gives $A_{\rm adv} \sim 10\,{\rm km^2} \ll A_{\rm wedge}$. Although both areas contribute, we neglect $A_{\rm adv}$ compared to $A_{\rm wedge}$, and we use this estimate for the area surveyed $A_{\rm survey} \approx A_{\rm wedge}$ to determine how the inferred population of dust devils depends on the survey parameters.

\section{Imaging Surveys for Distant Dust Devils}
First, we consider the accuracy with which we could infer the occurrence rate of dust devils detected very distant from the instrument suite and that register only on the camera instrument. We can relate the areal density $N$ (dust devils per unit area) for a certain period of interest from the total number of dust devils observed in a single image $k$:
\begin{equation}
   N = \frac{k}{A_{\rm survey}} = \left( \frac{2 \alpha^2}{\Delta_{\rm FOV} D^2} \right)\ k.
    \label{eqn:areal_occurrence}
\end{equation}

If we assume that dust devil occurrence is a Poisson process, then we can estimate the standard deviation or uncertainty on $k$ as $\sigma_k = \sqrt{k}$ and the uncertainty $\sigma_N$ on our estimate of $N$ via
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sigma_N}{N} = \frac{\sigma_k}{k} = k^{-1/2} = \sqrt{2} N^{-1/2} D^{-1}\ \Delta_{\rm FOV}^{-1/2} \alpha.
    \label{eqn:sigma_N}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/DDs_vs_Delta.jpg}
    \caption{The expected range of dust devils recovered in an image as a function of field-of-view $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$ (filled blue region). The survey precision, $\sigma_N/N$ is shown as a dash-dot, orange line. The calculation here assumes $N = 0.03\,{\rm km^{-2}}$, $D = 10\,{\rm m}$, and $\alpha = 1\,{\rm mrad}$.}
    \label{fig:DDs_vs_Delta}
\end{figure}

% Usually, we would design our survey so that we achieve a sufficiently precise estimate for the quantity of physical significance $N$. In other words, we would require $\sigma_N/N < T$, some threshold. We can see that Equation \ref{eqn:sigma_N} provides the specific requirements to achieve the desired threshold. For instance, we can take some typical values from \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} and estimate what minimum angular resolution is required of our camera to achieve $T = 0.1$:
% \begin{equation}
%     \alpha < 2^{-1/2} T \left( n t \right)^{1/2} D\ \Delta_{\rm FOV}^{1/2} = 2^{-1/2} \left( 0.1 \right) \big[ \left( 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}} \right) \left( 1\,{\rm hr} \right) \big]^{1/2} \left( 10\,{\rm m} \right) \left( \pi/2\,{\rm rad} \right)^{1/2} \approx 0.2\,{\rm mrad}.
%     \label{eqn:alpha_example}
% \end{equation}
% Such an angular resolution is about ten times better than is usually achieved -- the MER Hazcams used for the survey in \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} had a resolution of $2\,{\rm mrad/pix}$ \citep{2003JGRE..108.8071M}.

Another application of Equation \ref{eqn:sigma_N} might instead involve assuming requiring a minimum survey accuracy $T = \sigma_N/N$ and asking, for a given camera field-of-view, what angular resolution is required. Figure \ref{fig:alpha_vs_Delta} shows the result: an accuracy of $T = 50\%$ can be achieved with $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 150^\circ$ and a modest $\alpha = 1\,{\rm mrad}$ (i.e., resolving a dust devil with pixels across if the pixels each have a resolution of $0.3\,{\rm mrad\, pix^{-1}}$), again for $N = 0.03\,{\rm km^{-2}}$.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/alpha_vs_Delta.jpg}
    \caption{The $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$-$\alpha$ combinations required to achieve a desired survey accuracy $T = \sigma_N/N$. The calculation here assumes $N = 0.03\,{\rm km^{-2}}$ and $D = 10\,{\rm m}$.}
    \label{fig:alpha_vs_Delta}
\end{figure}

However, dust devils are usually active only for a few hours during each day (or sol on Mars) -- \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} found negligible activity before 9 a.m. LTST or after 5 p.m. LTST. Moreover, the occurrence rate itself seemed to evolve over the course of the active phase, increasing from $0.005\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ early in the morning to  $0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ around noon. This mid-day peak agrees with meteorological predictions that dust devil activity should increase as the planetary boundary layer deepens with increasing surface heating \citep{doi:10.1029/2010RG000351}. Accurately estimating the occurrence rate requires a survey duration not longer than the timescale of variability, i.e., about an hour. Therefore, the 25-hours of survey required to recover $n = 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$ to 10\% accuracy would have to be spread into 1-hour surveys around noon spanning 25 sols. (And, of course, smaller occurrence rates would require additional time.) 

Similarly, \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} reported an occurrence rate that varied with season and $L_{\rm S}$. Assuming sufficient daily coverage to accurately capture the daily occurrence rate (i.e., a large enough value for $n t$), we can ask what $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$ might be required to recover the seasonal variability by looking at the expected variation in $n t$. From its peak in spring to the peak in summer, $n t$ dropped from $0.11\,{\rm km^{-2}}$ to $0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}}$, which would require a precision $\sigma_n/n \sim 0.5$. Solving Equation \ref{eqn:sigma_n} gives $\Delta_{\rm FOV} \approx 65^\circ$. Considering instead the maximum $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 360^\circ$ and an areal occurrence $nt = 0.11\,{\rm km^{-2}}$ suggests we could recover dozens of 10-m wide dust devils. 

Importantly, all these calculations up till now have assumed a single dust devil diameter, $D$. In fact, dust devils span a range of diameters - \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} reported values between 2 and $276\,{\rm m}$, while orbital studies have reported devils hundreds of meters across \citep{2008Icar..197...39S}. However, the distribution of diameters appears to follow a steep power law, with an exponent between 1 and 2 \citep{2016SSRv..203..277L}. Consequently, the majority of devils reported in \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} lay between 10 and $20\,{\rm m}$, and so $n$ is dominated by devils in this range and the calculations presented so far may be considered reasonably representative. In addition, for a given angular resolution, larger dust devils can be recovered from farther away, an observational bias that has been previously pointed out \citep{2012Icar..219..556K, 2013Icar..226..964L}.

On the other hand, given that larger dust devils are less common, they may be intrinsically less likely to be recovered. Equation \ref{eqn:areal_occurrence_rate} may be adapted to allow for a distribution of dust devils by diameter by simply taking $n$ to represent the areal occurrence rate in a narrow range of diameters and $k$ to represent the number of devils observed within that same range of diameters. From Equation \ref{eqn:areal_occurrence_rate}, we can see that if $n$ were a steeply declining function of $D$ (e.g., $n \propto D^{-3}$), then the total number of devils recovered with smaller diameters would exceed the number with larger diameters in proportion to $D^{-1}$.

More than simply counting dust devils, a survey might consider also assessing dust devil dynamics. In their survey, \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} constructed 21-frame short movies of dust devils in order to estimate their advective motions. By tracking the motions of visually distinct eddies within dust devils, they also estimated vertical velocities, ranging from $0.2$ to $8.8\,{\rm m\ s^{-1}}$, and therefrom the atmospheric dust flux. 

In addition to sufficient time resolution (the movies analyzed in \citealt{2006JGRE..11112S09G} had a few seconds between frames), such an estimate requires sufficient angular resolution. Eddies within a dust devil span a range of sizes but all smaller than the host devil itself. In order for the motion of such an eddy to be resolvable, it must span a few pixels. At a minimum, the devil itself must be larger, occupying many times as pixels as the eddy, a minimum number of pixels $p_{\rm min}$.

In order for a dust devil with diameter $D$ to occupy $p_{\rm min}$ pixels, it must pass within a radial distance $r$ of the camera, given by 
\begin{equation}
    r \le \frac{D}{p_{\rm min} \alpha}.
    \label{eqn:encounter_distance}
\end{equation}
Passing within that radial distance requires the devil to pass through a pie-wedge area $A$ smaller than that corresponding to $r_{\rm max}$ but with the same opening angle $\Delta_{\rm FOV}$.

The time between encounters with such a dust devil $\tau_{\rm enc}$ can be estimated using $r$:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{\rm enc} = \left( n A \right)^{-1} = \bigg[ \left( \frac{n \Delta_{\rm FOV}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{D}{p_{\rm min} \alpha } \right)^2 \bigg]^{-1}.
    \label{eqn:tau}
\end{equation}
For example, if we require a 10-m dust devil occupies 10 pixels (i.e., passes within $1\,{\rm km}$ of a camera with $\alpha = 1\,{\rm mrad}$ and $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 65^\circ$), with $n = 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$, $\tau_{\rm enc} = 35\,{\rm hrs}$. In other words, a survey would require 35 hours of observation for such a small devil to pass so close to the camera. Assuming the same occurrence rate for 100-m devils, the same encounter distance would only require $\tau_{\rm enc} \approx 20\,{\rm min}$. However, the relative rarity of such large dust devils means encounters with such large devils would occur rarely. Figure \ref{fig:encounter_time} shows the encounter times for different diameters and various fields-of-view.

\section{Assessing the Dust Flux}
Accurate recovery of the dust devil population, in particular the largest devils, may be critical to assess the contribution of dust devils to the martian dust budget. By tracking vertical velocities and optical depths within imaged dust devils, \citet{2006JGRE..11112S09G} estimated dust flux values $q$ for 300 devils, with values ranging between $3.95\times10^{−9}$ and $4.59\times10^{−4}\,{\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ with an average $2.07\times10^{−5}\,{\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$, although no information is given regarding the dependence on diameter or any other parameter. Assuming this dust flux applies uniformly across diameter, it suggests the total dust contribution for a devil scales with that devil's areal footprint, i.e.~with $D^2$. We can use these values to explore how well we can estimate the dust flux for a given dust devil population.

Taking the areal occurrence rate of dust devils with a diameter within a small interval around $D$ as $dn/dD = n_0 D^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma$ between 1 and 2 \citep{2016SSRv..203..277L}. (As before, the area of an individual dust devil does not factor into the areal occurrence rate.) This expression translates into a number of devils observed during a survey of duration $t$ and within a narrow range of diameters $dk/dD = \left( dn/dD \right) A_{\rm survey} t$. Taking the rate of dust mass lifting for a single devil as $Q = q\ \pi D^2$, we can estimate the population-weighted rate as 
\begin{equation}
    Q_{\rm tot} = \int_{D_{\rm min}}^{D_{\rm max}} \left( \frac{dk}{dD} \right) q\ \pi D^2 dD = \int_{D_{\rm min}}^{D_{\rm max}} n_0 D^{-\gamma} \left( \frac{t \Delta_{\rm FOV} D^2}{2 \alpha^2} \right) q \pi D^2\ dD.
    \label{eqn:dust_lifted}
\end{equation}
Although the dust flux $q$ likely depends on $D$ itself, the dependence is unknown, and so for simplicity, we will assume $q = {\rm const.}$, yielding 
\begin{equation}
    \langle Q \rangle = \pi q n_0 \left( \frac{t \Delta_{\rm FOV}}{2 \alpha^2} \right) \left( \frac{D_{\rm max}^{5 - \gamma} - D_{\rm min}^{5 - \gamma}}{5 - \gamma} \right) \approx \left( \frac{ \pi q n_0 }{2 \left( 5 - \gamma \right)} \right) \left( \frac{t \Delta_{\rm FOV}}{\alpha^2} \right) D_{\rm max}^{5 - \gamma},
    \label{eqn:solved_dust_lifted}
\end{equation}
with $\gamma < 5$ and $D_{\rm min} \ll D_{\rm max}$. For a representative estimate, we can take $q = 2.07\times10^{−5}\,{\rm kg\ m^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$, $n_0 = 0.05\,{\rm km^{-2}\ hr^{-1}}$, $\gamma = 1$, $t = 25\,{\rm hrs}$, $\Delta_{\rm FOV} = 65^\circ$, $\alpha = 1\,{\rm mrad}$, and $D_{\rm max} = 100\,{\rm m}$, giving an estimate $\langle Q \rangle \approx 4 {\rm g\ hr^{-1}}$.

\section{Meteorological Time-Series}
Analyzing the pressure time-series from the Insight lander, \citet{2020arXiv200501134S} reported an unprecedented number of vortex detections, 9,019 in all. Their detection scheme was simple: they sought dips in the pressure time-series $\Delta P$ with a magnitude greater than $0.3\,{\rm Pa}$ of a rolling average within a window 1000-seconds wide. Figure \ref{fig:vortex_illustration} illustrates the $\Delta P$-values and sol of all the vortices reported, along with the profiles of some examples.

The earlier and more accurately a lander could register an encounter with such a vortex, the better the vortex could be probed by other instruments on the lander. To this end, we analyzed the Insight pressure time-series to explore a variety of strategies to detect the vortices in the incipient stages of the encounter.

\section{Effects of Undersampling the Dust Devil Profile}
With too low a sampling frequency, the pressure profile for a dust devil will be undersampled, potentially distorting the inferred profile shape and depth. Fourier analysis of the pressure profile can show the dependence of the distortion on the angular sampling frequency $\omega$.

We start by assuming a Lorentzian profile $L(t)$ in time $t$ for the dust devil:
\begin{equation}
    L(t) = -\frac{\Delta P}{1 + \left( t/\Gamma \right)^2},
    \label{eqn:appendix_lorentzian}
\end{equation}{}
where $\Delta P$ is the profile depth and $\Gamma$ its duration. The Fourier transform of this profile $F(\omega)$ is 
\begin{equation}
    F(\omega) = -\pi \Delta P\ \Gamma e^{-|\omega| \Gamma}.
    \label{eqn:appendix_lorentzian_fourier}
\end{equation}{}

If we now imagine that we undersampled the profile using frequencies below some maximum, $\omega \le \omega_{\rm max}$, then we can estimate the resulting distorted profile $L^\prime(t)$ by taking the inverse, partial Fourier transform of $F(t)$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    L^\prime(t) \equiv \int_{\omega = -\omega_{\rm max}}^{\omega_{\rm max}}\ \left( -\pi \Delta P \Gamma e^{-|\omega| \Gamma}\right) \ \left( \frac{e^{+i\omega t}\ d\omega}{2 \pi} \right)
    = L(t) \bigg[ 1 - \left( \cos \left( \omega_{\rm max} t \right) - \left( \frac{t}{\Gamma} \right) \sin \left( \omega_{\rm max} t \right) \right) e^{-\omega_{\rm max} \Gamma} \bigg].
    \label{eqn:appendix_inverse_fourier}
\end{equation}{}

We expect the register the maximum (in magnitude) pressure excursion at the center of the profile, i.e. $L(t = 0) = \Delta P$, and so to estimate the incorrect profile depth $\Delta P^\prime$ arising from this distorted profile, we can evaluate $L^\prime(t)$ at the same time, giving:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta P^\prime = \Delta P \left( 1 - e^{-\omega_{\rm max}\Gamma} \right).
\end{equation}{}
The distortion decreases rapidly with $\omega_{\rm max}$, and for a sampling frequency of, for example, $2\,{\rm Hz}$ ($\omega_{\rm max} = 2\pi \times (2\,{\rm Hz})$) and a very narrow profile $\Gamma = 0.5\,{\rm s}$, $\Delta P^\prime$ is only 0.2\% different from $\Delta P$.
